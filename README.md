# DA5401: Assignment 8

Submitted by: **Devashish Tripathi**

Roll Number: **DA25C006**

Public repository for the Assignment 8 for the course DA5401.

Assignment is contained in the [DA5401_Assignment8_DA25C006.ipynb](DA5401_Assignment8_DA25C006.ipynb) file. All sections have been run. 
In case rerun is to be done, you can get the Bike Sharing Dataset dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset). 
Download the zip file and unzip it in the same folder as the notebook. For convenience, the dataset file ([hour.csv](hour.csv)) is also provided in the repository. The sections conducting Grid Search are left commented out to reduce the runtime, with the optimal values used for any operations. If needed, those parts may be uncommented.

The libraries needed are provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). The code runs in a jupyter environment and assumes that it is present on the platform where the code is to be run.

I have used *italics* in the markdown wherever I have stated some observation or fact, to distinguish it from the rest of the markdown text.

Thank you :D
